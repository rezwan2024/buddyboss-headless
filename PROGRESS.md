# PROGRESS.md

Living state of the project. Claude Code reads this at the start of every session
and updates it at the end. Newest entries at the top.

Keep it short. This is a status file, not a diary. Scope lives in `PLAN.md`,
reasoning in `DECISIONS.md`, rules in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Current state

**Phase:** 0 — Harness — done. Next up: Phase 1 — Scaffold.
**Next task:** Scaffold the Next.js app (App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind,
Biome), `lib/wp-fetch.ts`, connect GitHub repo to Vercel, configure Playwright MCP.
See `PLAN.md` Phase 1.

## Blockers

None.

## How to see the frontend

Not scaffolded yet — from Phase 1 onward:

    pnpm dev        # then open http://localhost:3000

Keep it running in its own terminal. Claude Code can also open the page itself
once the Playwright MCP is configured in Phase 1.

**Live URL:** not deployed yet. Vercel gets connected in Phase 1; after that every
push to `main` deploys automatically. Record the URL here once it exists.

## Open questions

- Does the remote site get periodically refreshed from production? If so, the JWT
  plugin needs redeploying after each refresh.
- Are media URLs CDN-offloaded? Check what the API actually returns before
  configuring `next.config.js`.

## Env vars

Every entry here must exist in **both** `.env.local` and the Vercel dashboard.
Add to this list whenever a new one is introduced.

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `WP_URL` | BuddyBoss REST base URL — set locally to `https://st2-rezwan.hz2.developbb.dev` in `.env.local`. Still needs adding to the Vercel dashboard once the project exists (Phase 1). |

## Session log

### 2026-08-27 — Phase 0 complete: API introspection

- Added `WP_URL=https://st2-rezwan.hz2.developbb.dev` to `.env.local`
- Wrote `scripts/introspect-api.ts` — GET-only, unauthenticated (no auth exists
  yet), fetches every route in `docs/routes.txt` and writes the raw response to
  `docs/samples/<slug>.json`. Runs directly via `node` — Node 24 strips TS types
  natively, no ts-node/tsx needed.
- Regex path placeholders (e.g. `(?P<id>\d+)`) resolved to real IDs pulled from
  the live site (member 3, activity 373, group 5, forum 702, topic 196, reply
  290, xprofile field/group 1) so samples reflect real data, not 404s, where
  content exists. Media/video/document/poll tables are empty on this site, so
  those routes sampled a 404 — still a useful shape.
- Ran it: 152/152 routes fetched, 0 errors. ~948K of samples on disk.
- Phase 0 is done — every item in `PLAN.md` is checked off.

### 2026-08-27 — Setup

- Created project at `~/buddyboss-headless`
- SSH key auth working to the BuddyBoss dev site (key at `~/.ssh/bb/id_bb`)
- Confirmed WP-CLI 2.11 and MariaDB available on the server, so no local
  WordPress install is needed
- Built `./scripts/wp`, `./scripts/pull`, `./scripts/push`
- Pulled the WordPress root (~900MB) into `./remote/`
- Captured 153 `buddyboss/v1` routes into `docs/routes.txt`
- Confirmed all 16 BuddyBoss components active, Platform Pro installed
- Verified write access end to end by creating a BuddyBoss activity post
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`
- Created Vercel account and GitHub repo
  (https://github.com/rezwan2024/buddyboss-headless, public)
- Confirmed `remote/` and `.env.deploy` are gitignored — the repo is public, so
  neither may ever be committed

## How to update this file

At the end of a session, Claude Code should:

1. Update **Current state** — phase and the single next task, taken from `PLAN.md`
2. Add or clear **Blockers**
3. Add any new env var to the **Env vars** table
4. Add a dated entry to **Session log** — what changed, in a few bullets
5. Append to `DECISIONS.md` if a non-obvious choice was made

Before marking a task done, check it against **Definition of done for a task** in
`CLAUDE.md`.

Don't restate the plan here — that's `PLAN.md`. Don't explain reasoning here —
that's `DECISIONS.md`.
